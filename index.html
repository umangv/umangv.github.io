  <p>I am a mathematician and programmer. I am interested in Sparse Analysis and Machine Learning and have been working on Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis as part of my dissertation work. Some of this work has involved developing <a href="https://picturedrocks.github.io/">PicturedRocks</a>, an open-source tool with feature selection algorithms for this context. In the past, I have also developed various open-source projects, some of which include:<p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://launchpad.net/indicator-stickynotes">Indicator Stickynotes</a>, a stickynotes application for the Ubuntu desktop,</li>
    <li><a href="https://launchpad.net/pynagram">Pynagram</a>, an anagram word game, and 
    <li><a href="https://github.com/umangv/LitHub">LitHub</a>, a book trading website software.</li>
  </ul>
